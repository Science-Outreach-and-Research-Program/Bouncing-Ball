## Ideas for Lab 11

### Could make a basic simulation with:
- different balls/different surfaces
  - (basically different constants of elasticity)
- different starting heights

### What the students should understand at the end
- what factors affect bounce height
  - also what factors do not affect bounce height
    - mass: bowling balls of different mass
	- gravity: dropping balls on mars (?)
- what is the relationship between bounce height and the initial height
  - linear, inverse, quadratic, etc
